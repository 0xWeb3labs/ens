# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
ganache -b 3
npm run depoly-localhost
```

*OR*

Check out `./hardhat.config.js`, modify the section about Rinkeby, and then:

```shell
npm run depoly-rinkeby
```
